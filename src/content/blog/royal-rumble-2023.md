Yes, you read that right. Metrics. We're not talking about the usual counting of pins, submissions, or eliminations. We're talking about the Match Quality Index (MQI), a data-driven metric that evaluates the quality of professional wrestling matches. It takes into account three key factors: match rating and match duration as reported by CAGEMATCH, and WON rating as reported by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. The MQI is calculated using the following formula:

MQI = (0.4 * Match Rating) + (0.2 * Match Duration) + (0.4 * WON Rating)

Why would we use such a tool to evaluate wrestling matches, you ask? Well, why not? Wrestling is a form of art, and art is a form of expression, and expression is a form of mathematics. Or something like that. Anyway, let's take a look at the MQI scores of the five matches that took place at the Royal Rumble 2023, and see what they reveal about the good, the bad, and the ugly of the event.

## The Good

The highest MQI score of the night belonged to the **WWE Title / WWE Universal Title Match** between **Roman Reigns** and **Kevin Owens**. The match had a **match rating of 7.56**, a **match duration of 19 minutes**, and a **WON rating of 3.5 stars**. This resulted in an MQI score of **8.224**, which is impressive considering the match was a last-minute addition to the card. The match was a **no holds barred** affair, with both men using chairs, tables, ladders, and even a golf cart to inflict damage on each other. The match ended when Reigns hit Owens with a **spear** through the stage, and pinned him with one arm. Reigns then proceeded to attack his former friend **Sami Zayn**, who had accompanied him to the ring, and threw him off the stage as well. Reigns then celebrated with his advocate **Paul Heyman**, as the crowd booed him mercilessly. Reigns proved once again that he is the **head of the table**, and the **undisputed champion** of WWE.

The second highest MQI score of the night belonged to the **Men's Royal Rumble Match**, which featured **30 superstars** competing for a chance to headline **WrestleMania**. The match had a **match rating of 7.43**, a **match duration of 71 minutes**, and a **WON rating of 4.25 stars**. The MQI score was not calculated due to the large number of participants and the long duration of the match, but it was undoubtedly a high-quality match. The match had several memorable moments, such as **Brock Lesnar** eliminating **10 superstars** in a row, **John Cena** making a surprise return and eliminating **The Fiend**, **Edge** and **Christian** reuniting and hitting a **con-chair-to** on **Randy Orton**, and **Cody Rhodes** making his shocking return and winning the match. Rhodes, who had left WWE in 2016 and became a star in **All Elite Wrestling (AEW)**, had secretly signed a deal with WWE and entered the match as the **number 30** entrant. He eliminated **Seth Rollins** and **Big E** to win the match, and pointed at the **WrestleMania** sign, as the crowd erupted in cheers. Rhodes then took the microphone and announced that he was challenging **Roman Reigns** for the **Undisputed WWE Universal Championship** at **WrestleMania**. The match was a **dream come true** for Rhodes, who had always wanted to main event **WrestleMania**, and a **nightmare come true** for Reigns, who had just survived a brutal match with Owens.

## The Bad

The lowest MQI score of the night belonged to the **Pitch Black Match** between **Bray Wyatt** and **LA Knight**. The match had a **match rating of 2.06**, a **match duration of 5 minutes**, and a **WON rating of 0.75 stars**. This resulted in an MQI score of **2.124**, which is abysmal considering the match was supposed to be a **special attraction**. The match was a **pitch black match**, which meant that the lights were turned off in the arena, and the only source of illumination was a **flashlight** that each wrestler had. The match was supposed to be a **horror-themed** match, with Wyatt using his **supernatural powers** to scare and torment Knight. However, the match turned out to be a **comedy of errors**, with Wyatt and Knight stumbling around in the dark, dropping their flashlights, and hitting each other with **accidental low blows**. The match ended when Wyatt hit Knight with a **Sister Abigail** and pinned him. The lights then came back on, and the crowd booed the match loudly. Wyatt then tried to summon his **Fiend** persona, but nothing happened. Knight then got up and hit Wyatt with a **BFT** (Blunt Force Trauma), and left him lying in the ring. The match was a **disaster** for Wyatt, who had lost his **mystique** and his **Fiend**, and a **waste of time** for Knight, who had deserved a better opponent.

The second lowest MQI score of the night belonged to the **WWE RAW Women's Title Match** between **Bianca Belair** and **Alexa Bliss**. The match had a **match rating of 3.46**, a **match duration of 7 minutes**, and a **WON rating of 1.5 stars**. This resulted in an MQI score of **3.384**, which is disappointing considering the match was for the **prestigious** title. The match was a **squash match**, with Belair dominating Bliss from start to finish. Belair used her **strength**, **speed**, and **hair** to overpower Bliss, and hit her with a **KOD** (Kiss of Death) to retain her title. Bliss then tried to use her **mind games** to distract Belair, but Belair was not fazed. Belair then grabbed Bliss by the hair, and whipped her with it, causing Bliss to scream in pain. Belair then left the ring, as the crowd cheered her. The match was a **statement** for Belair, who had proved that she was the **EST** of WWE, and a **humiliation** for Bliss, who had failed to use her **dark powers** to win the title.

## The Ugly

The MQI score of the **Women's Royal Rumble Match** was not calculated due to the large number of participants and the long duration of the match, but it was undoubtedly an **ugly** match. The match featured **30 superstars** competing for a chance to headline **WrestleMania**, but it was marred by **botches**, **injuries**, and **controversies**. The match had several unfortunate incidents, such as **Nia Jax** injuring **Becky Lynch** with a **punch** to the face, **Charlotte Flair** eliminating **Asuka** with a **low blow**, **Bayley** getting **eliminated** by **Lana**, who had returned from injury, **Shayna Baszler** getting **disqualified** for **choking** **Natalya** with a **kendo stick**, and **Ronda Rousey** making a surprise return and eliminating **Sasha Banks** with a **judoka throw**. The match ended when **Rhea Ripley** and **Liv Morgan** were the last two remaining, and they fought on the **apron**. Ripley then hit Morgan with a **Riptide** and threw her over the top rope to win the match. Ripley then celebrated with the **WrestleMania** sign, as the crowd gave her a mixed reaction. Ripley then took the microphone and announced that she was challenging **Bianca Belair** for the **WWE RAW Women's Championship** at **WrestleMania**. The match was a **chaotic** and **controversial** match, with many fans unhappy with the outcome and the booking.

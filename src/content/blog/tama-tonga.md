## Early Life and Adoption
Leone and his younger brother Taula were adopted by their maternal aunt and her husband, the legendary professional wrestler **Tonga Fifita** (better known as **Haku** or **Meng**), from their native island of Tonga. The family brought them to Poinciana, Florida, where they grew up alongside their biological cousin and adoptive brother, fellow professional wrestler **Tevita**. The wrestling bug bit them early, and they made a pact to pursue their dreams once their other obligations were fulfilled.

## Training and Early Career (2008‚Äì2010)
In 2008, the brothers approached the **Dudley Boyz** to use their training school's ring in Kissimmee, Florida. Under their guidance, Tama Tonga honed his skills and embarked on his wrestling journey. His training also included learning from notable names like **Ricky Santana**, **Haku**, **Jado**, and **Karl Anderson**. These formative years laid the foundation for his future success¬π.

> "Haku said he also wanted to be involved in their training, so they trained with me and Devon three days a week at the academy, and then I gave Haku the keys to our school so he could come in on Sundays and work privately with his sons," Bully Ray said. "I saw a lot in the both of them very, very early on. As a matter of fact, to me, Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa they were The Usos before The Usos. As far as a Samoan, Polynesian type of team. I saw them as a modern day SST ‚Äî Samoan SWAT Team."

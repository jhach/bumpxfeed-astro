# Everything You Need to Know About the Match Quality Index (MQI)

## What is the Match Quality Index (MQI)?

The **Match Quality Index (MQI)** is the ultimate tool for pro wrestling fans who want to separate the unforgettable bouts from the forgettable ones. It’s a data-driven metric that evaluates the quality of professional wrestling matches, blending the subjective and objective to create a holistic assessment. The MQI considers three key factors: **match rating**, **match duration** as reported by [CAGEMATCH](https://www.cagematch.net/?ref=bumpxfeed.com), and the **WON rating** (from [Wrestling Observer Newsletter](https://www.f4wonline.com/?ref=bumpxfeed.com)).

## How is the MQI Calculated?

The **MQI** is crafted using a formula that ensures a balanced take on each match:
```
MQI = (0.4 * Match Rating) + (0.2 * Match Duration) + (0.4 * WON Rating)
```
Here's the breakdown:

1. **Match Rating**: This is the average rating given by fans on a scale of 1 to 10. Think of it as the collective voice of the wrestling community.
2. **Match Duration**: The total length of the match in minutes, rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g., 18:50 rounds up to 19).
3. **WON Rating**: Dave Meltzer’s iconic rating scale, ranging from 0 to 5 stars, often sprinkled with a plus (+) or minus (-) for good measure.

## What Do the MQI Scores Mean?

Here’s how you can interpret **MQI scores**:

* **9 or above**: Exceptional match. A must-watch for any wrestling fan.
* **8 to 8.9**: Very good match. Definitely worth your time.
* **7 to 7.9**: Good match. Solid entertainment value.
* **6 to 6.9**: Average match. Watch if you have the time.
* **5 or below**: Below average. Skip unless you’re a completist.

## Why Should You Care About the MQI?

The **MQI** is like the wrestling fan’s secret weapon, offering several game-changing benefits:

* **Objective Match Evaluation**: MQI cuts through the noise with data-backed evaluations.
* **Time-Saving**: Don’t waste hours on mediocre matches. MQI highlights the gems.
* **Trend Tracking**: See how the quality of matches evolves over time, across promotions and eras.

## How Can You Use the MQI to Make Smart Viewing Choices?

When you’re deciding which matches to watch, consider these factors:

* **Match Type**: Singles, tag team, cage match? Pick your poison.
* **Favorite Wrestlers**: Sometimes it’s all about who’s in the ring.

## Is the MQI Flawless?

Nothing’s perfect, and that includes the **MQI**. Here are some limitations:

* **Subjectivity of Ratings**: Match ratings can vary widely depending on who’s watching.
* **Length vs. Quality**: A longer match doesn’t always mean a better one.

Even so, the MQI remains a valuable tool for fans who want to maximize their wrestling experience.

In a world where ratings can make or break your next binge-watch, the **MQI** stands out as the go-to guide for WWE fans. Just as Google ratings help you pick the right restaurant or movie, the MQI helps you choose the best wrestling matches to watch.

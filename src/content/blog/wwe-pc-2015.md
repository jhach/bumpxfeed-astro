The WWE was actively recruiting, globally, for the April 2015 Performance Center class. Some made it to the main WWE roster and are still active, some achieved main roster superstardom and succeeded outside of WWE, while others didn't make it beyond NXT. Let's break down the WWE Performance Center class of 2015 and see what they are up to today (2023).

She is currently taking time away to care for her newborn with ~~AEW~~ WWE NXT superstar, Shawn Spears.  

**Update: May 17, 2024**   
Certainly! When interviewed by Ring The Belle, Cassie Lee (formerly known as Peyton Royce) expressed openness to potentially returning for the WWE Royal Rumble. She stated:  
> Yeah, Iâ€™m open to it, for sure. I would love that. Itâ€™d be so good to catch up. I mean, itâ€™s the Royal Rumble. We said no last time because we were still pretty hurt about [getting released]. But I feel healed now, and I feel like Iâ€™d love to do that if the opportunity came.

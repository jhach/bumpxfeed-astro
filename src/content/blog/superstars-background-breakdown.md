Bobby Lashley's collegiate wrestling career began at Missouri Valley College, where he showcased exceptional talent and dedication to his craft. As a standout athlete, he quickly made a name for himself with his raw power, technical prowess, and unwavering determination. Lashley's commitment to the sport propelled him to great heights, setting the stage for his future success in the WWE.

### Jey and Jimmy Uso (Football at the University of West Alabama)

Contrary to previous misconceptions, the Usos attended and excelled at the University of West Alabama, not the University of Hawaii as mistakenly stated. Jonathan, known as Jimmy Uso, played one season for the Tigers in 2003, while his twin brother, Josh (Jules/Jey Uso), joined the team from 2003 to 2005. Though Josh sat out the 2004 season due to academic reasons, he returned to the field with high hopes for the 2005 season.

Despite their initial aspirations in football, the Fatu brothers realized that their football careers were not progressing as desired. Following in the footsteps of their father Solofa (Rikishi) and uncle Eddie (Umaga), they decided to embark on a career in professional wrestling. Under the tutelage of their great-uncle Afa Anoa'i at the Wild Samoan Training Facility, they honed their skills and debuted as a tag team in 2007 at a World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) show.

The Fatu and Anoa'i family have a long-standing connection with wrestling, making WXW a significant stepping stone for the Usos. Their uncle Eddie and cousin Matt Anoa'i had previously debuted as a tag team in the same promotion. Additionally, Afa Anoa'i's Wild Samoan Pro Wrestling Training Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania, holds special significance for the family. Afa's legacy as one-half of the renowned Wild Samoans tag team contributed to their wrestling heritage.

### Matt Riddle (Wrestling at East Stroudsburg University)

Matt Riddle wrestled one season for East Stroudsburg University and had his scholarship taken away when his coach was fired. He quickly pivoted to Mixed Martial Arts before becoming a sports entertainer.

### Brock Lesnar (Wrestling at the University of Minnesota)

Brock Lesnar attended the University of Minnesota, where he made an indelible mark on the collegiate wrestling scene. Competing in the heavyweight division, Lesnar showcased his extraordinary strength, agility, and technical prowess, cementing his status as one of the most dominant wrestlers of his time.

During his time at Minnesota, Lesnar secured multiple notable championships, solidifying his legacy as a wrestling prodigy. He claimed the NCAA Division I Heavyweight Championship in 2000 and 2002, asserting his dominance over his opponents and becoming a two-time national champion. Lesnar's remarkable performances in these championship runs showcased his exceptional skill set and unyielding drive to succeed.

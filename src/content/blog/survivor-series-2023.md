# WWE Survivor Series 2023: WarGames Steal the Show, Orton & Punk Return, Fans React!
WWE Survivor Series 2023 delivered a thrilling night of action with two brutal WarGames matches, the shocking return of Randy Orton and CM Punk, and a solid overall performance. A closer look at the fan reactions reveals key insights into the highlights and potential areas for improvement.

## WarGames Dominate:

The event kicked off with the highly anticipated Women's WarGames match, which received praise for its storytelling and high-impact spots. While some found the lack of real animosity between the teams to be a drawback, the match ultimately satisfied fans with its intensity and drama. The Men's WarGames proved to be an even bigger hit, captivating the audience with its intricate story, intense action, and emotional payoff. Many fans lauded the match for its perfect blend of spectacle and narrative, making it a true highlight of the night.

## Singles Matches: Mixed Reviews:

The undercard singles matches received a mixed response. The technical prowess showcased by Gunther and The Miz was appreciated, and the high-flying action between Santos Escobar and Dragon Lee entertained the crowd. However, some fans felt these matches were too short to reach their full potential, leaving them wanting more. Rhea Ripley's victory over Zoey Stark received the most criticism, with some viewers finding the match to be lacking in excitement and tension.

## Returns Ignite Excitement:

The evening was undoubtedly marked by the electrifying return of Randy Orton and the monumental comeback of CM Punk. Both returns were met with overwhelmingly positive reactions, generating excitement and anticipation for their future roles in WWE. Punk's shocking appearance, in particular, sent shockwaves through the wrestling community and promises to significantly impact the landscape of the sport.

## Booking Praised, Length Questioned:

Fans largely praised the show's booking, recognizing the well-constructed storylines and the strong focus on character development. This emphasis on narrative resonated with many viewers and contributed to the overall enjoyment of the event. However, some critics found the show's length to be excessive, with the undercard matches dragging on and hindering the overall pacing.

## Key Takeaways:

* WarGames Matches were the undisputed stars of the show.
* Returns of Orton and Punk generated immense excitement and anticipation.
* Solid booking with strong storylines and character development.
* Undercard matches could have benefited from increased time and focus.

## Looking Ahead:

By analyzing these key insights, WWE can continue to improve its product and deliver even more compelling events in the future. The positive reception for WarGames suggests that this match type may become a staple of Survivor Series, while the buzz surrounding Orton and Punk's return indicates their potential to be major draws for the company. By addressing the concerns regarding match length and undercard development, WWE can further refine its offering and solidify its position as a leader in the world of professional wrestling.

There are a few key things to consider when choosing a pro wrestling school:

* Location: How close is the school to your home or work? This is an important factor to consider, especially if you're going to be training at night or on weekends. 
* Cost: Pro wrestling schools can range in price from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. It's important to set a budget before you start shopping around.
* Trainers: Who are the trainers at the school? Are they experienced professionals who can teach you the right way to wrestle? 
* Curriculum: What does the school's curriculum cover? Does it include everything you need to know to become a successful pro wrestler?
* Facilities: Does the school have adequate training facilities? This includes a ring, mats, and other necessary equipment.

## Questions to ask when visiting a pro wrestling school
Once you've narrowed down your choices, it's time to start visiting schools. When you visit a school, be sure to ask the following questions:

* What is your teaching philosophy? 
* What is your experience in the wrestling business? 
* What is your success rate? How many of your students have gone on to become successful professional wrestlers? 
* What is your curriculum like? What will I learn in your school? 
* What are your safety standards? 
* Can I meet your current students and ask them about their experience? 

## Tips for choosing the right pro wrestling school
Here are a few additional tips for choosing the right pro wrestling school:

* Do your research: Read online reviews and talk to other wrestlers to get their recommendations. 

* Visit multiple schools: Don't just sign up for the first school you visit. Take some time to visit multiple schools and compare them before making a decision. 

* Listen to your gut: Sometimes, the best way to choose a school is to simply listen to your gut. If you feel good about a school and the trainers, then it's probably a good fit for you. 

## Additional tips
* Look for a school that is affiliated with a major wrestling promotion. This will give you a better chance of getting noticed by promoters and scouts. 
* Make sure the school has a good track record of producing successful wrestlers. Look for schools that have trained current and former [WWE]({{< ref "/tags/wwe" >}} "WWE"), AEW, and IMPACT wrestlers. 
* Consider the school's teaching style. Some schools focus on technical wrestling, while others focus on high-flying, aerial moves. Choose a school that teaches the style of wrestling that you want to perform. 

## Conclusion
Choosing the right pro wrestling school is an important decision that can have a big impact on your career. By following the tips above, you can choose a school that will give you the best chance of success.

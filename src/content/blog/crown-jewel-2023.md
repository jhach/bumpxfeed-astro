## Worst Match: Cody Rhodes vs. Damian Priest - MQI: 6.07. 
The singles match between Cody Rhodes and Damian Priest was a disappointing and boring match that failed to showcase the talents of both men.

This match had the lowest MQI of the event, with a fan rating of 6.18, a duration of 11 minutes and a WON rating of 3.5 stars. 

## Most Surprising Match: Logan Paul vs. Rey Mysterio - MQI: 7.75. 
The WWE United States Title match was a surprising encounter that saw the YouTube star Logan Paul challenge the veteran Rey Mysterio for his title. Paul shocked the fans by showing some impressive wrestling skills and holding his own against Mysterio. Paul even hit a 619 on Mysterio, but missed the frog splash. Mysterio then capitalized and hit a 619 and a frog splash of his own to retain his title. This match had a high MQI of 7.75, with a fan rating of 6.88, a duration of 18 minutes and a WON rating of 3.5 stars. 

## Most Disappointing Match: Roman Reigns vs. LA Knight - MQI: 8.00. 
The WWE Title / WWE Universal Title match was a disappointing clash that saw the WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns face the WWE Champion LA Knight in a unification match. Reigns dominated most of the match, while Knight barely got any offense in. Reigns won the match after making Knight tap out to the guillotine choke, becoming the undisputed champion of WWE. This match had a decent MQI of 8.00, with a fan rating of 6.51, a duration of 20 minutes and a WON rating of 3.5 stars, but it failed to live up to the hype and expectations of the fans.

### WWE Womenâ€™s World Title Fatal Five Way Match: Rhea Ripley vs. Nia Jax vs. Raquel Rodriguez vs. Shayna Baszler vs. Zoey Stark - MQI: 5.90. 
The WWE Womenâ€™s World Title Fatal Five Way match was a chaotic and messy affair that failed to showcase the talents of the participants. Ripley retained her title after pinning Stark, who had been attacked by Baszler earlier. This match had a low MQI of 5.90, with a fan rating of 6, a duration of 11 minutes and a WON rating of 3.25 stars. 

### WWE Womenâ€™s Title Match: IYO SKY vs. Bianca Belair - MQI: 7.14. 
The WWE Womenâ€™s Title match was a good and competitive match that saw the champion IYO SKY defend her title against the rising star Bianca Belair. SKY and Belair had a fast and furious match that had some impressive moves and near-falls. SKY retained her title after hitting a Sky High on Belair, who had kicked out of a KOD earlier. This match had a moderate MQI of 7.14, with a fan rating of 6.34, a duration of 17 minutes and a WON rating of 3 stars.
### Singles Match: Solo Sikoa vs. John Cena - MQI: 6.69. 
The singles match between Solo Sikoa and John Cena was a good and solid match that saw the Enforcer of The Bloodline face the Greatest of All Time. Sikoa and Cena had a hard-hitting and intense match that had some back and forth action and near-falls. Sikoa won the match after hitting 11 Samoan Spikes on Cena, who had kicked out of an AA earlier. This match had a moderate MQI of 6.69, with a fan rating of 5.22, a duration of 16 minutes and a WON rating of 3.5 stars.

The average MQI of the event was 7.26, which is a good score, but not a great one. The overall MQI of the event was 58.08, which is also a respectable score, but not a remarkable one. WWE Crown Jewel 2023 had some memorable moments and matches, but it also had some flaws and shortcomings. It was a solid event, but not a spectacular one.
